# FourFours
A project which aims to solve the [Four Fours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_fours) problem.

To run the program, run the `fourfour.py` file. You should see a text file called `4-4s.txt` in your directory. 
You may also tweak some parameters such as the problem basis, number of operators used and computational range within `settings.py`.

In the examples folder are some included examples with various settings turned on as to show the possibilities of this algorithm.
